Data Import
  Single image import
    Importing .pngs
      currentImgString = strcat('img', num2str(sample,'%03d'), '-', ...
            num2str(img,'%03d'), '.png');
      img001_001 = imread(currentImgString);
    Converting to grayscale
      img001_001 = rgb2gray(img001_001);
    Resize image
      img001_001 = imresize(img001_001, 0.1);
      //TODO find out which method is best
    Rearranging
      img001_001 = reshape(img001_001,1,10800);
    Preprocessing
      Sometimes the letters are skewed or not centered in the image and often they have a different height <-- !!!
      //TODO Does this effect predicition? Do we need preprocessing?
